How long did you spend working on this project?
About 8 hours including entertainment time.
I watched an episode of DareDevil when I got stuck.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I was stuck at add_to_products.
After added that methods, my @@products array was always empty.
I spent some time on researching and found out I shouldn't be using .each method because the initial array was empty and my code wouldn't run.

What two additional features did you build? Why?


Where do you still have room to grow?
A lot. It is still not crystal clear to me how classes interact with each other.
Also I want to learn cooler looping methods to make my code shorter.
